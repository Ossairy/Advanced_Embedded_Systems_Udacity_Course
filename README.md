# Advanced_Embedded_Systems_Udacity_Course
This Repo. includes 3 projects that was required to graduate from udacity nanodegree course -Advanced embedeed systems-.
The first project is an ARM project :

   - Implementing Interrupt driver
   - Implementing GPIO driver
   - Implementing Timer driver 
  After Implementing the required driver the project require using those driver to control LED PWM Signal applied on TM4C123GH6PM Simulator using Kiel software.

The second project is a FreeRTOS project :

   - the project aim is to implement Earliest DeadLine first Schedular on FreeRTOS.


The third project an Embedded System Design project :

    - Implement fully static design for automotive door control system design.
    - Implement fully dynamic design for automotive door control system design.
