verify the EDF scheduler, you need to implement an application:
"1. Create 4 tasks with the following criteria:

Task 1: ""Button_1_Monitor"", {Periodicity: 50, Deadline: 50}
This task will monitor rising and falling edge on button 1 and send this event to the consumer task. (Note: The rising and failling edges are treated as separate events, hence they have separate strings)

Task 2: ""Button_2_Monitor"", {Periodicity: 50, Deadline: 50}
This task will monitor rising and falling edge on button 2 and send this event to the consumer task. (Note: The rising and failling edges are treated as separate events, hence they have separate strings)

Task 3: ""Periodic_Transmitter"", {Periodicity: 100, Deadline: 100}
This task will send preiodic string every 100ms to the consumer task

Task 4: ""Uart_Receiver"", {Periodicity: 20, Deadline: 20}
This is the consumer task which will write on UART any received string from other tasks
"
"2. Add a 5th and 6th task to simulate a heavier load:

Task 5: ""Load_1_Simulation"", {Periodicity: 10, Deadline: 10}, Execution time: 5ms
Task 6: ""Load_2_Simulation"", {Periodicity: 100, Deadline: 100}, Execution time: 12ms
verify your system implementation with the EDF scheduler using the following methods:
"1. Using analytical methods calculate the following for the given set of tasks:

    Calculate the system hyperperiod
    Calculate the CPU load
    Check system schedulability using URM and time demand analysis techniques (Assuming the given set of tasks are scheduled using a fixed priority rate -monotonic scheduler)

Note: For all the tasks you should calculate the execution time from the actual implemented tasks using GPIOs and the logic analyzer"
"2. Using Simso offline simulator, simulate the given set of tasks assuming:

    Fixed priority rate monotonic scheduler "
    "3. Using Keil simulator in run-time and the given set of tasks:

    Calculate the CPU usage time using timer 1 and trace macros

    Using trace macros and GPIOs, plot the execution of all tasks, tick, and the idle task on the logic analyzer"
    "For this criteria please deliver the following:

    A PDF report that includes screenshots from the above verification methods and their results. Your report shall also include a comment on the results of these analysis (Ex: Are the results as expected ?, Does the results indicate a successful implementation ?, etc ...).
    Deliver main.c, task.c and freertosconfig.h"
