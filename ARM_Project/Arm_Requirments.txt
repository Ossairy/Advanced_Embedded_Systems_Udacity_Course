Control blinking of an LED for a user-defined ON and OFF periods

Create a function in the App layer that takes as an input from the user a specific ON time and OFF time in seconds, lights a LED for the given ON time, and dim it for the given OFF time. Itâ€™s prohibited to use predefined delay functions, only timer driver functions can be used. This function implements implicitly the PWM module using Timer Overflow.

deliver a schematic/block diagram according to your understanding of the requirements.
Create a COTS folder for the whole course including a folder for each layer in the layered architectureto include MCAL,HAL,SERVICE,APPLICATION and LIBRARIES
